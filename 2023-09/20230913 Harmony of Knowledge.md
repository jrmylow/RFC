Mathematical elegance

A broad, interdisciplinary education

Abstraction and connection-building

Differential equations are key to understanding how to derive solutions for many problems in chemistry and physics.

When I took chemistry classes, I didn't particularly hate them, nor did I particularly like them. The classes had reasonably fun and hands-on experiments, amusing facts and factoids about various chemicals, and perhaps most importantly, wasn't like various other subjects that I did actively dislike. On the other hand, it had a fair degree of rote learning and (seemingly) arbitrary rules that I had to keep track of, and as I eventually started picking and choosing my subjects more, I dropped it in favour of other things.

A few years later, with a couple of other courses under my belt, I happened to look at some aspects of chemistry with fresh eyes. Specifically, I now looked at reaction speeds and the calculations around them with a level of interest I hadn't ever experienced before.

What changed?

Over the course of my degree I took courses in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and vibration analysis. Much of the key theory and models within these courses has to do with modelling the systems using differential equations and then solving for the boundary conditions of the model.

Importantly, the "secret technique" that was often missed in solving these equations was to search for the solution in the form e^x or similar - things that had been taught in calculus courses.

It's hard to describe the feeling of realising that these different domains (vibrations, chemical reactions, and more) are held together with similar techniques for diferential equations and that there are common techniques for solving them. It may seem obvious to others, but it certaily wasn't to me at the time.

I'm not so presumptious as to think that everyone learns or thinks the same way that I do. However I think it's generally true that learning knowledge that appears in different disciplines helps providei useful context and reinforces other knowledge.

Why bring this up?

Potentially it hints at some underlying technique for teaching - where teachers can stimulate curiosity in students by linking ideas across other subjects. Perhaps it hints at a more fundamental truth - that knowledge that is true exists in harmony with the rest of things. Perhaps it's useful in choosing a mix of education as a parent - suggesting that sufficient breadth and depth is needed to sustain interest...
