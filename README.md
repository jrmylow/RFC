# RFC: Requests for Comment
This space is where I share and iterate on WIP thoughts prior to publishing.

I welcome comments and thoughts as I iterate through these items.

This process means that items in this repository are highly likely to have errors, inaccuracies, contradictions, and other faults.

All thoughts in this repository are my own. I do not speak for my current or past employers, or any other entity/organisation for that matter.

If you have an important decision to make, please seek advice from someone you can trust (which may be a professional lawyer, doctor, engineer, accountant, etc.)
